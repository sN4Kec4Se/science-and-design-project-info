# Science & Design, Inc.

We're a 501(c)(3) non-profit that builds free and open-source products that enable free access to information and free speech online. We care about accessibility, usability, privacy, and security and provide support for aligning non-profits and open-source projects. Through our guiding principles of access, safety, and education, we aim to create positive impact at scale.

Some of our products include:
- Hush Line, a self-hosted anonymous tip line for organizations and individuals.
- Pi Relay, an easy way to transform a Raspberry Pi into a Tor relay, enabling home users to safely contribute back to the Tor Network.
- Page Builder enables anyone to build single page, single file websites that weighs around 14KB, compared to the median page weight of 2.2MB.

We partner with other aligning non-profits like Distributed Denial of Secrets, and are the fiscal sponsors of OnionShare, a tool facilitating anonymous peer-to-peer file transfers, web hosting, chatting, and dropbox functionality.
