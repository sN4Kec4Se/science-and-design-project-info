# **Pi Relay Project Info**

## Info

Pi Relay is a free and open-source tool that transforms a Raspberry Pi into a relay for the Tor Network, aiming to enhance internet safety and access. It is especially beneficial in regions where internet censorship is present. Users such as journalists, librarians, and businesses can utilize Pi Relay to contribute the resiliency and performance of the Tor Network. Pi Relay facilitates the navigation through internet restrictions, upholds privacy, and assists in secure access. By supporting a network that counters digital security threats, it contributes to the broader goals of human rights, open societies, and internet freedom. The tool features an e-paper display to visually highlight user contributions.

## Users

- Civil Society Professioanls can use Pi Relay to help grow the size of the Tor Network.
- Newsrooms can run a Bridge to offer their journalists direct and reliable access to the Tor Network.
- Librarians can run a network of Pi Relay devices to use public instistutions for the digital advancement of free knowledge.
- Businesses can run Pi Relay to donate larger amounts of bandwidth to speeding up the Tor Network.

## Use Cases

- Civil Society Professionals: As a human rights advocate in a region with internet censorship, I need to set up a Pi Relay, so that I can contribute to expanding the Tor Network and facilitate more secure and uncensored internet access for myself and others in my community.
- Journalists and Newsrooms: As a journalist reporting on sensitive issues, I need to have a reliable and secure way to access and share information, so by using Pi Relay, I can consistently connect to the Tor Network and protect my sources and myself from surveillance.
- Librarians: As a librarian at a public library, I need to promote free access to knowledge. By establishing a network of Pi Relay devices, I can contribute to digital literacy and free information access, helping patrons circumvent censorship and access global resources.
- Businesses: As a business that values digital privacy and freedom of information, I need to contribute to the Tor Network. By running Pi Relay, I can donate bandwidth, thus enhancing the network's speed, availability, and overall performance.

## Locations

- Global
- Areas where censorship is prevalent, including Iran, China, Russia, and Belarus

## **Problems we're solving**

Only 20% of the world's internet users enjoy internet freedom, according to Freedom House's 2020 Freedom on the Net report [1]. This statistic marks the continuation of a decade-long slide in global internet freedom.

Internet freedom is heavily compromised in countries like China, Iran, Russia, and Belarus due to aggressive surveillance and control measures, including keyword filtering, IP blocking, and DNS tampering [2]. These practices suppress free speech, limit access to information, and drive pervasive surveillance.

As a countermeasure to online censorship and surveillance, the Tor network offers users an anonymous connection to the internet, making their activities difficult to track and control. However, the efficacy of the Tor network depends heavily on the number and distribution of its volunteer-operated servers or 'relays'.

With around 6,000 active relays as of July 2023, the Tor network faces significant challenges in consistently providing secure, fast, and reliable connections worldwide, particularly in high censorship areas [3]. Dingledine, Mathewson, and Syverson (2004) highlighted the direct relation between Tor network's performance and its number of relays [4]. Similarly, a 2016 study by Greschbach et al. found improved Tor connections' speed and performance with increased relay density in a geographic area [5]. This underscores the importance of expanding the Tor relay network, a goal made easier by tools like Pi Relay.

Pi Relay empowers anyone with a Raspberry Pi, an affordable mini-computer, to set up a Tor relay effortlessly. This democratizes the relay setup process, thereby improving the Tor network's growth, resilience, and efficiency. Each addition of a Pi Relay to the system pushes forward the global fight against internet censorship, enhancing privacy, security, and freedom in digital communication.
