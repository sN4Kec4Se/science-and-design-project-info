# **Pi Relay Project Info**

## Info

Pi Relay is a free and open-source tool that transforms a Raspberry Pi into a relay for the Tor Network, aiming to enhance internet safety and access. It is especially beneficial in regions where internet censorship is present. Users such as journalists, librarians, and businesses can utilize Pi Relay to contribute the resiliency and performance of the Tor Network. Pi Relay facilitates the navigation through internet restrictions, upholds privacy, and assists in secure access. By supporting a network that counters digital security threats, it contributes to the broader goals of human rights, open societies, and internet freedom. The tool features an e-paper display to visually highlight user contributions.

## Users

- Civil Society Professioanls can use Pi Relay to help grow the size of the Tor Network.
- Newsrooms can run a Bridge to offer their journalists direct and reliable access to the Tor Network.
- Librarians can run a network of Pi Relay devices to use public instistutions for the digital advancement of free knowledge.
- Businesses can run Pi Relay to donate larger amounts of bandwidth to speeding up the Tor Network.

## Use Cases

- Civil Society Professionals: As a human rights advocate in a region with internet censorship, I need to set up a Pi Relay, so that I can contribute to expanding the Tor Network and facilitate more secure and uncensored internet access for myself and others in my community.
- Journalists and Newsrooms: As a journalist reporting on sensitive issues, I need to have a reliable and secure way to access and share information, so by using Pi Relay, I can consistently connect to the Tor Network and protect my sources and myself from surveillance.
- Librarians: As a librarian at a public library, I need to promote free access to knowledge. By establishing a network of Pi Relay devices, I can contribute to digital literacy and free information access, helping patrons circumvent censorship and access global resources.
- Businesses: As a business that values digital privacy and freedom of information, I need to contribute to the Tor Network. By running Pi Relay, I can donate bandwidth, thus enhancing the network's speed, availability, and overall performance.

## Locations

## **Problems we're solving**

According to the Freedom on the Net 2020 report by Freedom House, only 20% of global internet users live in regions classified as "free" in terms of internet freedom [1]. This statistic emphasizes a decade-long decline of internet freedom.

Countries such as China, Iran, Russia, and Belarus exercise strong control and surveillance over their internet spaces, employing methods such as keyword filtering, IP blocking, and DNS tampering to censor content and control digital discourse [2]. These practices result in a compromised online environment that suppresses free speech, restricts access to information, and perpetuates surveillance.

The Tor network serves as a crucial countermeasure to such online censorship and surveillance. It provides users with an anonymous connection to the internet, making it difficult for adversarial parties to track their activities or control their access to information. However, the efficacy of the Tor network depends heavily on the number and geographic distribution of its volunteer-operated servers or 'relays'.

As of July 2023, the Tor network comprises approximately 7,000 active relays globally [3]. While this may seem substantial, it is insufficient to cater to the global demand for secure, fast, and reliable Tor connections, particularly in high censorship regions.

This is the gap that Pi Relay aims to address. Pi Relay allows anyone with a Raspberry Pi, a cost-effective mini-computer, to effortlessly set up a Tor relay. This democratizes the relay setup process, thereby contributing to the growth, resilience, and efficiency of the Tor network. Each Pi Relay added to the system advances the global fight against internet censorship, promoting privacy, security, and freedom in digital communication.
