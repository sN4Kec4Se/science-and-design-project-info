# **Pi Relay Project Info**

## Info

Pi Relay is a free and open-source tool that transforms a Raspberry Pi into a relay for the Tor Network, aiming to enhance internet safety and access. It is especially beneficial in regions where internet censorship is present. Users such as journalists, librarians, and businesses can utilize Pi Relay to contribute the resiliency and performance of the Tor Network. Pi Relay facilitates the navigation through internet restrictions, upholds privacy, and assists in secure access. By supporting a network that counters digital security threats, it contributes to the broader goals of human rights, open societies, and internet freedom. The tool features an e-paper display to visually highlight user contributions.

## Users

- Civil Society Professioanls can use Pi Relay to help grow the size of the Tor Network.
- Newsrooms can run a Bridge to offer their journalists direct and reliable access to the Tor Network.
- Librarians can run a network of Pi Relay devices to use public instistutions for the digital advancement of free knowledge.
- Businesses can run Pi Relay to donate larger amounts of bandwidth to speeding up the Tor Network.

## Use Cases

- Civil Society Professionals: As a human rights advocate in a region with internet censorship, I need to set up a Pi Relay, so that I can contribute to expanding the Tor Network and facilitate more secure and uncensored internet access for myself and others in my community.
- Journalists and Newsrooms: As a journalist reporting on sensitive issues, I need to have a reliable and secure way to access and share information, so by using Pi Relay, I can consistently connect to the Tor Network and protect my sources and myself from surveillance.
- Librarians: As a librarian at a public library, I need to promote free access to knowledge. By establishing a network of Pi Relay devices, I can contribute to digital literacy and free information access, helping patrons circumvent censorship and access global resources.
- Businesses: As a business that values digital privacy and freedom of information, I need to contribute to the Tor Network. By running Pi Relay, I can donate bandwidth, thus enhancing the network's speed, availability, and overall performance.

## Locations

- Global
- Areas where censorship is prevalent, including Iran, China, Russia, and Belarus

## **Problems we're solving**

The ubiquity digital connectivity has amplified the necessity for internet freedom - the right to privacy, free speech, and unrestricted access to online information. However, this freedom isn't a reality for many people across the globe. According to the Freedom on the Net 2020 report by Freedom House, internet freedom has been declining for the tenth consecutive year, with only 20% of the world's internet users residing in countries where the internet is designated as "free" [1].

This trend reflects the extensive measures many governments take to control information flow, infringe on user privacy, and suppress dissenting voices. Censorship prevails in countries like China, Iran, Russia, and Belarus, where the government employs sophisticated methods to control internet access, monitor citizens' online activities, and manipulate online discussions [2].

The Tor network is a critical tool in this battle for internet freedom, as it provides an avenue for anonymous, unrestricted internet access. It helps people in repressive environments circumvent censorship, protects the identity of whistleblowers, journalists, and activists, and shields sensitive data from surveillance. However, the effectiveness and speed of the Tor network depend on the number of relays or nodes that make up the network. As of July 2023, there are approximately 6,000 relays in the Tor network [3].

Pi Relay addresses these challenges by transforming a Raspberry Pi into a Tor relay, thereby making it simpler for individuals and organizations to contribute to the Tor network's growth and robustness. By contributing to the Tor network, users directly support the efforts to counteract internet censorship, surveillance, and threats to online freedom and privacy.
