# **Page Builder Project Info**

## Info

Page Builder is a tool that simplifies the process of creating efficient, single-page websites, built on the belief that anyone should be able to contribute to the digital sphere, regardless of technical skills or financial resources. It optimizes performance by using system default fonts, resulting in website sizes that are on average 90% smaller than the web average of 2MB [[1](https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-the-web)]. Additionally, the tool produces mobile-responsive sites, a crucial feature as nearly half of global web traffic now comes from mobile devices [[2](https://www.statista.com/statistics/683082/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices-usa/)]. Page Builder can function entirely offline in a user's browser for enhanced security and privacy, especially beneficial in regions facing internet censorship. Whether the pages you design are used in their default state or as a base for further customization, Page Builder offers a path towards a more inclusive digital landscape.

## **Problems we're solving**

The problem our project addresses is the pervasive digital divide and the barriers to accessible web creation. According to the World Bank, around 3.7 billion people are not yet connected to the internet, predominantly in poorer countries, rural areas, and among marginalized communities1. Coupled with this are the challenges faced by those living under oppressive regimes, where the freedom to express oneself and access unbiased information online is significantly curtailed.

For instance, in 2020, Freedom House reported that internet freedom declined for the 10th consecutive year, with governments using the pandemic as a justification to suppress online speech and inhibit access to information [2]. Particularly concerning was the situation in countries like Belarus and Myanmar, where repressive governments imposed internet blackouts and widespread website blocks [3][4].

Page Builder aims to address these issues by offering a straightforward, cost-free way to create lightweight, single-page websites. The approximately 14KB sites generated are a fraction of the median page size, which as of 2020, stands at 2.2MB [5], making them accessible even in areas with limited bandwidth. This allows users in high-censorship environments to circumvent prevalent website blocks and blackouts. For added privacy and security, websites can be securely shared through Signal or quickly deployed via OnionShare.

If left unaddressed, the digital divide threatens to grow, exacerbating inequalities and further suppressing the voices of marginalized communities. While our immediate focus is on high-censorship environments, the issues we aim to tackle are not confined to these regions. The need for easy-to-use web creation tools is universal - from rural business owners looking to establish an online presence, to activists seeking to share resources. By democratizing web creation, Page Builder contributes to a more equitable digital landscape, underscoring the importance of internet freedom.
