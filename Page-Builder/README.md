# **Page Builder Project Info**

## Info

Page Builder is a tool that simplifies the process of creating efficient, single-page websites, built on the belief that anyone should be able to contribute to the digital sphere, regardless of technical skills or financial resources. It optimizes performance by using system default fonts, resulting in website sizes that are on average 90% smaller than the web average of 2MB [[1](https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-the-web)]. Additionally, the tool produces mobile-responsive sites, a crucial feature as nearly half of global web traffic now comes from mobile devices [[2](https://www.statista.com/statistics/683082/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices-usa/)]. Page Builder can function entirely offline in a user's browser for enhanced security and privacy, especially beneficial in regions facing internet censorship. Whether the pages you design are used in their default state or as a base for further customization, Page Builder offers a path towards a more inclusive digital landscape.

## Users

- Civil Society Professioanls can use Pi Relay to help grow the size of the Tor Network.
- Newsrooms can run a Bridge to offer their journalists direct and reliable access to the Tor Network.
- Librarians can run a network of Pi Relay devices to use public instistutions for the digital advancement of free knowledge.
- Businesses can run Pi Relay to donate larger amounts of bandwidth to speeding up the Tor Network.

## Use Cases

- Civil Society Professionals: As a human rights advocate in a region with internet censorship, I need to set up a Pi Relay, so that I can contribute to expanding the Tor Network and facilitate more secure and uncensored internet access for myself and others in my community.
- Journalists and Newsrooms: As a journalist reporting on sensitive issues, I need to have a reliable and secure way to access and share information, so by using Pi Relay, I can consistently connect to the Tor Network and protect my sources and myself from surveillance.
- Librarians: As a librarian at a public library, I need to promote free access to knowledge. By establishing a network of Pi Relay devices, I can contribute to digital literacy and free information access, helping patrons circumvent censorship and access global resources.
- Businesses: As a business that values digital privacy and freedom of information, I need to contribute to the Tor Network. By running Pi Relay, I can donate bandwidth, thus enhancing the network's speed, availability, and overall performance.

## Locations

- Global
- Areas where censorship is prevalent, including Iran, China, Russia, and Belarus

## **Problems we're solving**

Over the past decade, internet freedom has been in consecutive decline, according to Freedom House's 2020 Freedom on the Net report, which assesses internet freedom in 65 countries, accounting for 87% of the world's internet users [1]. Countries like China, Myanmar, India, Iran, Russia, and Belarus employ aggressive surveillance and control measures, including arrests of journalists, use of spyware, IP blocking, and DNS tampering [2]. These practices suppress free speech, limit access to information, and drive pervasive surveillance.

As a countermeasure to online censorship and surveillance, the Tor network offers users an anonymous connection to the internet, making your physical location and online activity difficult to track and control. However, the efficacy of the Tor network depends heavily on the number and distribution of its volunteer-operated servers or relays.

With around 7,000 active relays as of July 2023, the Tor network faces significant challenges in consistently providing secure, fast, and reliable connections worldwide, particularly in high censorship areas [3]. Dingledine, Mathewson, and Syverson (2004) highlighted the direct relation between the Tor network's performance and its number of relays [4]. Similarly, a 2016 study by Greschbach et al. found improved Tor connections' speed and performance with increased relay density in a geographic area [5]. This underscores the importance of expanding the Tor relay network, a goal made easier by tools like Pi Relay.

Pi Relay empowers anyone with a Raspberry Pi, an affordable mini-computer, to set up a Tor relay effortlessly. This democratizes the relay setup process, thereby improving the Tor network's growth, resilience, and efficiency. Each addition of a Pi Relay to the system pushes forward the global fight against internet censorship, enhancing privacy, security, and freedom in digital communication.
