# Science & Design, Inc.

We're a 501(c)(3) non-profit that builds free and open-source software with the themes of anti-censorship, anti-corruption, free speech, and free access to information. 

Some of our products include Hush Line, a self-hosted anonymous tip line, Pi Relay, an easy way to transform a Raspberry Pi into a Tor relay, enabling home users to safely contribute back to the Tor Network. Page Builder enables anyone to build single page, single file websites that weighs around 14KB, compared to the median page weight of 2.2MB.

We partner with other non-profits like Distributed Denial of Secrets to help build usable, accessible, and private software.

We also want to support underresourced open-source projects, and are the fiscal sponsors of OnionShare, a tool facilitating anonymous peer-to-peer file transfers, web hosting, chatting, and dropbox functionality.
