## I. Unboxing

1. How would you rate the first-impressions of the packaging?
    - 1 - Don't ship this in production
    - 2 - It's fine
    - 3 - Okay to ship

2. Why did you give it that rating?

3. Does the seal on the box provide enough assurance you've received a product that hasn't been tampered with?

## II. Setup

1. Does the instructions card give you enough information to successfully set up the device?

2. If no, what additional information would you need to set it up successfully?

3. After plugging in ethernet and powering up, how was the wait time until seeing the QR code?
   - 1 - It was too long
   - 2 - It was okay
   - 3 - No problem

4. How did you set up Hush Line?
   - Scanned the code
   - Manually entered the URL

5. How did you feel when you received the confirmation email?

6. Do you need any other information in that email?

7. How useful is the e-paper display?
    - 1 - I don't need it
    - 2 - I might need it
    - 3 - Don't take it away

9. Rate how easy it was to set up:
    - 1 - Too Hard, I couldn't set it up
    - 2 - Not Easy. I got through it, but found it confusing.
    - 3 - Neutral. Got through it and it's running!
    - 4 - Easy. Wow, that was a lot easier than expected.
    - 5 - Perfection*. Wouldn't change a thing*.<br>
          *Ô∏è‚É£ There's no such thing as perfection, and of course it can improve.

## III. Usage

1. Hush Line Personal Server requires a plugged-in ethernet cable - does that work for you, or do you need an option for wi-fi connection?

2. When we sell the first production units, should we include a power supply and ethernet cable? Yes or no.

3. Why did you answer the previous question the way you did?

4. Should we offer a headless (no-display) version of the Personal Server?

5. Was there anything missing from the messaging interface, or did you like it the way it is? 

6. Does the information in the To: block meet your needs? 

7. Do you need to attach files?

8. Why did you answer the previous question the way you did?

9. Thinking about the Information page, should this be customizable for your use case, or is it okay the way it is? How would you like to customize it?

10. Did you try the "Close App" button? Is this needed for your community? Are there any changes needed?

## IV. Closing Thoughts

1. Does the name "Hush Line Personal Server" make sense to you?

2. How much would you pay for a device like this? 

3. How much is too much?

4. Should we build this thing? Yes or no. Why?
    
5. Anything else you'd like to add?
